# Fantasy-League
Creating a way to automatically track and score player and team statistics. Current capability is to scrape individual matches on Gol.GG for team names and statistics and player names.

Next steps for the project are to scrape individual player scores, aggregate the scraped data into one database, then add logic to summarizing scores (individual and best-ofs).
